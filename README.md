# house_price_prediction
## Dataset
The dataset used for this project is the well-known "Boston Housing" dataset available in the scikit-learn library. The data contains various features related to housing in different neighborhoods in Boston and the corresponding median house prices.

## Data Preprocessing
Before training the linear regression models, the dataset underwent some preprocessing steps, including handling missing values, feature scaling, and feature engineering to enhance the predictive performance of the models.

## Linear Regression Models
The following linear regression models were used for this project:

Linear Regression
Lasso Regression
Ridge Regression
ElasticNet Regression
Each model was trained using a train-test split with 80% of the data used for training and 20% for testing.

## Model Evaluation
The performance of each linear regression model was evaluated using the Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared (R2) metrics. The achieved MSE and R2 scores for each model are included in the results section of the code.
